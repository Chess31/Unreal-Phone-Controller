# Unreal-Phone-Controller
Stores html for the SuperCanvas Unreal Engine project

The webpage collects phone sensor data (motion and orientation). The data is sent to my local node.js server. The local server sends OSC messages to Unreal Engine, which runs on the same machine the node.js server does.
